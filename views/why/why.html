<h1>Why I wrote a JS framework ?</h1>

<p>
  I am writing software for quite a long time and mostly on web technologies since early 2000's. 
  A few years ago, I came to JS development with modern tools that came along with NodeJS rising and feel very comfortable with the language 
  and technologies that floating around. 
</p> 
<p>
  But I always failed to find the framework that give me useful features without jail me in a tigh frame from which I can't escape without painful effort. 
</p>
<p>
  I think that at this point, most reader is preparing arguments about how awesome his favourite framework is.
</p>
<p>
    And you are all right. Most existing and popular framework are awesome pieces of technologies. 
    With fascinating concepts and high quality implementations.
</p>
<p>
    But I can't just find one that fit my need. And I think that I am not alone considering the endless 
    moving from framework to framework and the passionates debate around them.
</p>
<p>
    So, what is my expectation of a JS framework ?
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>It must be as technology agnostic as possible.</strong>
            The framework should be a coherent set of tool that I can use in any JS context: plain vanilla JS or transpiled javascript 
            (such as Babel or TypeScript). It can use legacy script import or CommonJS or ES6 module import. <br/>
            It should be as easy to add a third party library in the application as if you have no framework at all
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>It should be modulable</strong>
            I sometime whish to use some part of a framework but not another because I am in another context. 
            For example, if I am in a full JS stack with NodeJS server and one-page application client, I want to use the 
            whole framework but if I am in a Wordpress module, I want to use the view system but not the controller and database part.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>It should be as natural as possible</strong>
            If the framework behave in an unexpected way and I have to remember the framework concepts to realize 
            "oh yes, from the framework point of view, it is logical", the framework is not helping me.<br />
            I wrote this framework from my own development of real applications. Each time the framework did not react the 
            way I though it was, I fixed the framework, not the application.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>It should help me in the time consuming tasks</strong>
            The whole point of using a framework is to save our precious time. So the framework should focus on the
            tasks that we redo again and again. For example : create grid + CRUD form, create a user authentication system,
            creating an offline sync process, creating a modification tracking system...
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>It should do as less magical as possible</strong>
            Many framework do magical things that are great until the time that we need to understand what is behind the magic
            because we don't understand the behaviour of the framework (when you starting to have performances issues for example...).
            <br />
            We can't avoid to have some magic in a framework but I think that it must be as easy to understand as possible and 
            if a magic feature is actually not saving time of the developper, it should be remove because it will generate
            more problem than it solves
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    As co-founder and CTO of <a href="http://www.aetna-softwares.com" target="_blank">Aetna Softwares</a>, a small software company, I used to write my softwares without frameworks, just by assembling several
    pieces of great JS libs. And after some years of writings helpers libs for my project, I finally realize that I created something very like a framework... 
</p>
<p>
    As I was refactoring this all disparate pieces of code, I though that if it fit my needs, it also may fit other developers needs 
    so I decided to make an effort on documentation and go to open source it.
</p>

<h1>So, is it really a framework ?</h1>

<p>
    Yes and no. 
</p>
<p>
 Yes, because it may be used to get the structure of a new application from A to Z with very high level features.
</p>
<p>
  No, because you can take only one part of it and use as lib in your own code or within another framework system.
</p>

<h1>What is its main features ?</h1>

<p>
  In its first version, it will provide : 
  <ul>
      <li>A simple view system with the following concepts : 
          <ul>
              <li>Views are simple HTML/CSS files</li>
              <li>Views must : render data, get user input and emit event on user interactions</li>
              <li>Views must not : know the controller (no onClick="myController.myButtonClicked()"), 
                  do something without beeing explicitelly called (double data-binding), 
                  control the data (this is the role of controller)
              </li>
              <li>Handle i18n (through extension)</li>
              <li>High level field render : date, mask, grid, numbers, etc... (through extension)</li>
              <li>Automatic field creation from schema definition : define once, use everywhere (through extension)</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>A controller system : 
          <ul>
              <li>One-page routing with bookmarkable URL</li>
              <li>Easy data passing through controller</li>
              <li>Easy controller navigation with stackable routes</li>
              <li>Ready to use controller to do CRUD screens (grid/form)</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>A service API helper : 
          <ul>
              <li>Centralize all ajax calls</li>
              <li>Provide a clean client api to server endpoints</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Database management (server + client API)
          <ul>
              <li>Schema version management</li>
              <li>Clean client API to have logic in client controller but stay transactionnal</li>
              <li>Modification and delete tracking (through extension)</li>
              <li>Offline automatic synchronization (through extension)</li>
              <li>Integrated user management system (through extension)</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
  </ul>
